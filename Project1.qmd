## Introduction

The general goal of this project is to build functions to query the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) Census API and to do some simple analysis and plotting of this data. Our goal is to build functions which allow a user to modify arguments in the function to determine what data are returned from the query. The project is broken down into steps, starting with data processing, which addresses the query process, and then moves on to summarizing and testing steps.

## Data Processing

Here we build the query process. We start by loading relevant packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(lubridate)
```

Next, we start our data processing step by getting the process to work with a particular URL. We will use the URL provided on page 3 of the pdf which describes the requirements for Project 1.

The first step creates a string for the URL.

```{r}
URL_id <- 'https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/pums?get=SEX,PWGTP,MAR&SCHL=24'
```

The next step uses the `GET()` function from the `httr` package to get the data from the API, and uses the `str` function to view the structure of the object obatined.

```{r}
id_info <- GET(URL_id)
str(id_info, max.level = 1)
```

We see the object obtained is a list of length 10 and that the actual data is stored in an object in the list called `content`. We can see the type of content is raw, so we need to parse the data. To start this we can combine the `rawToChar` function with the `fromJSON` function from the `jsonlite` package.

```{r}
parsed <- fromJSON(rawToChar(id_info$content))
class(parsed)
head(parsed)
```

From the printout of the `parsed` object, we see that it is a character matrix with the column names assuming the first row of the matrix. In the next step we fix this by removing the first row and assigning it as the names of the object.

```{r}
parsed_data <- parsed[2:nrow(parsed),]
colnames(parsed_data) <- parsed[1,]
head(parsed_data)
```

Now that the matrix is in the desired form, we use the `as_tibble()` function from the `dplyr` package to convert it into a tibble.

```{r}
parsed_final <- as_tibble(parsed_data)
parsed_final
```

Now we have our desired result for a particular example URL.

In the next step, we write a helper function which takes an arbitrary URL (appropriate for API query) as an argument and returns a nice tibble. To do so, we will simply make slight modifications to the preceding code which performs this task for a particular URL.

```{r}
helper <- function(URL){
  id_info <- GET(URL)
  parsed <- fromJSON(rawToChar(id_info$content))
  parsed_data <- parsed[2:nrow(parsed),]
  colnames(parsed_data) <- parsed[1,]
  parsed_final <- as_tibble(parsed_data)
  parsed_final
}
```

We test the helper function on 2023 public use microdata and see it functions as desired.

```{r}
test <- helper('https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs1/pums?get=SEX,PWGTP,MAR&SCHL=24')
```

We see from the output that the function behaves as desired.

Our next task is to write a function to query the API that allows the user to change the items in the fashion laid out in the pdf for Project 1 description. We will name the function `query`. Comments are included in the code for the function to describe what is being done at each step.

The arguments to the function will be `year`, `num_var`, `cat_var`, and `geography`. In the list that follows we explain what can be passed to each argument.

1.  `year`: User provides the desired year in the form of an integer or double.

2.  `num_var`: User provides the desired numeric variables in the form of a character vector. As an example, provide `c('GASP', 'JWAP')` to the `num_var`argument to return the variables GASP and JWAP in the tibble. PWGTP will always be returned in the tibble even if not explicitly requested. AGEP and PWGTP are the default numeric variables returned in the tibble if no `num_var` argument is provided. Note that the time variables JWAP and JWDP are returned in military time so the result can be numeric. A result of NA means 'not a worker or worked from home.'

3.  `cat_var`: User provides the desired categorical variables in the form of a character vector. As an example, provide `c('FER', 'HHL')` to the `cat_var` argument to return the variables FER and HHL in the tibble. SEX is the default categorical variable returned in the tibble if no `cat_var` argument is provided. 

4.  `geography`: This is a rather flexible argument. The user can specify a specific state, region, or division to filter the data by. If a state, region, or division is passed to this argument, only the data from that state/region/division will be returned in the tibble. The desired state, region, or division should be passed to the argument as a string. The set of allowable states, regions, and divisions can be found at https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/pums/variables.html. The user must provide the state name itself, not the state code or the state abbreviation. The regions and divisions must be typed precisely as listed on the provided Census website; otherwise an error will be thrown. If the user wishes not to filter by state/region/division, but rather, to return all data values with the state specified in a column of the tibble, they should pass the argument 'State' to `geography`. Likewise they can pass 'Region' or 'Division' to the `geography` argument to return a Region or Division column without filtering. Finally, if the argument 'All' is passed to `geography`, all data will be returned with no filtering and no geography column.

```{r}
query <- function(year = 2022, num_var = c('AGEP'), cat_var = c('SEX'), geography = 'Iowa'){
